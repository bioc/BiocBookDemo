Package: BiocBookDemo
Title: Write, containerize, publish and versionize Quarto books with Bioconductor
Description: 
    A BiocBook can be created by authors (e.g. R developers, but also 
    scientists, teachers, communicators, â€¦) who wish to 1) write (compile a 
    body of biological and/or bioinformatics knowledge), 2) containerize
    (provide Docker images to reproduce the examples illustrated in the compendium), 
    3) publish (deploy an online book to disseminate the compendium), and 4) 
    versionize (automatically generate specific online book versions 
    and Docker images for specific Bioconductor releases).
