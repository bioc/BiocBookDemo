# `BiocBook` versioning system

::: {.callout-warning icon='true'}

## Important points

- Any **package** built using the {`BiocBook`} package is itself a {`BiocBook`}-based package;
- As such, it follows the release schedule from `Bioconducor`; 
- The `pages/` folder contains a number of pages which are rendered as a **website** using Quarto; 
- The **name** of the branch (`devel` or `RELEASE_X_Y`) is ***crucial***, as it is used to select a 
Bioconductor version to 1) build a **Docker image** for the {`BiocBook`}-based package 
and 2) render the `BiocBook` **website**.

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery

### From local to Github

When pushing a {`BiocBook`}-based **package** from a local `devel` branch to Github,
(e.g. when writing new articles), two jobs are automatically triggered from a single Github Actions workflow: 

1. First, a **Docker image** will be created to build the {`BiocBook`} package against the Bioconductor `devel` branch and push the resulting image to `ghcr.io/<github_user>/<package_name>:devel`;
2. Then, this image will be used to render the `BiocBook` **website** and deploy it to `https://<github_user>.github.io/<package_name>/devel/`

Additional commits on the `devel` branch will trigger regeneration of the `devel` Docker image and the online book `devel` version.

### Package submission to Bioconductor

Submission to Biconductor can follow the [same reviewing process](https://contributions.bioconductor.org/bioconductor-package-submissions.html#whattoexpect) as other standard packages. 

1. The author submits a book package to `Bioconductor/Contributions`; 
2. Once review starts, the package gets tested by Bioconductor's [*Single Package Builder*](https://github.com/Bioconductor/packagebuilder) (*SPB*); 
3. The author pushes changes to its Github repository; this will update the `devel` Docker image and the online book `devel` version; 
4. Regularly, the author bumps versions and push to Bioconductor's `upstream` branch to trigger a new *SPB* test run; 
5. Once the *SPB* returns no error/warnings, the package may be accepted; 
6. When a book package is accepted, it starts being regularly built by the [*Bioconductor Build System*](https://github.com/Bioconductor/BBS) (*BBS*). 
7. The *BBS* build automatically renders the book and deploys it online. 

![](images/submission.jpg)

At all time, the author's local `devel` branch should be synchronized with its Github remote `origin` as well as the Bioconductor `upstream` remote. 

- Any commit pushed to the remote Github `origin` remote will trigger a new Github Actions workflow and regenerate the `devel` Docker image and the online book **served by Github**. 
- Any commit pushed to the remote Bioconductor `upstream` remote will result in a new build by the **BBS** and an update of the **Bioconductor's hosted book**.

### New Bioconductor releases

When Bioconductor releases a version `X.Y`, the core team will automatically create a new `upstream:<package_name>@RELEASE_X_Y`. This will automatically trigger new builds of the **Bioconductor's hosted book** against the new release. 

When this occurs, the `upstream` branch can also be pulled 
to `origin:<package_name>@RELEASE_X_Y` to: 

1. Create a **Docker image** @ `ghcr.io/<github_user>/<package_name>:RELEASE_X_Y`, with the book **package** installed using Bioconductor `X.Y`;
2. Publish the book **website** to `https://<github_user>.github.io/<package_name>/X.Y/`, using packages from Bioconductor `X.Y`.

![](images/new_release.jpg)

::: {.callout-note icon='true'}

A {`BiocBook`}-based **package** can follow its own release life cycle if the autor does 
not intend to submit it to Bioconductor.  

If the author of a {`BiocBook`}-based **package** intends to submit this package/book/website 
to Bioconductor, the [Bioconductor submission and release life cycle](https://contributions.bioconductor.org/versionnum.html): 

- When developing a {`BiocBook`}-based **package** (at the submission and during review), the **package** version should be between `0.99.0` and `1.0.0`. 
- Once the submission is accepted and Bioconductor releases a new version `X.Y`, the {`BiocBook`}-based **package** version will automatically be bumped to `1.0.0` in Bioconductor release `X.Y` and to `1.1.0` in the continuing Bioconductor `devel`.

:::

### Updates 

After new releases, updates and/or hot fixes can still made, both on the latest Bioconductor release and on the `devel` branch. New commits will automatically trigger the regeneration of the Docker image and the online book for the modified branch(es). 

![](images/hot_fixes.jpg)

Additional Bioconductor releases will generate new versions of the Docker image and of the online book.

## Access to versioned Docker and online book

### Docker images versioning

The different versions of a `BiocBook` **Docker image** are availabed at the following URL: 

`ghcr.io/<github_user>/<package_name>`

For example, for this package ({`BiocBookDemo`}), the following **Docker image** versions are available: 

- [ghcr.io/js2264/biocbookdemo:devel](https://github.com/js2264?tab=packages&repo_name=BiocBookDemo) 
- [ghcr.io/js2264/biocbookdemo:3.17](https://github.com/js2264?tab=packages&repo_name=BiocBookDemo)
- [ghcr.io/js2264/biocbookdemo:3.16](https://github.com/js2264?tab=packages&repo_name=BiocBookDemo)
- [ghcr.io/js2264/biocbookdemo:3.15](https://github.com/js2264?tab=packages&repo_name=BiocBookDemo)

### Website versioning

The different versions of a `BiocBook` **website** are hosted at the following URL: 

`https://<github_user>.github.io/<package_name>/<version>`

For example, for this package ({`BiocBookDemo`}), the following **website** versions are available: 

- [https://js2264.github.io/BiocBookDemo/devel/](https://js2264.github.io/BiocBookDemo/devel/) 
- [https://js2264.github.io/BiocBookDemo/3.17/](https://js2264.github.io/BiocBookDemo/3.17/)
- [https://js2264.github.io/BiocBookDemo/3.16/](https://js2264.github.io/BiocBookDemo/3.16/)
- [https://js2264.github.io/BiocBookDemo/3.15/](https://js2264.github.io/BiocBookDemo/3.15/)

## Does this really work? 

The `BIOCONDUCTOR_DOCKER_VERSION` variable is set in all `Bioconductor` Docker images. 
For instance, this version of the `BiocBookDemo` package online book relies on: 

```{r}
Sys.getenv("BIOCONDUCTOR_DOCKER_VERSION")
```

::: {.callout-tip icon='true'}

Note that this variable will always match the `X.Y` version returned by `BiocVersion` 
used to render the online book. 

```{r}
packageVersion("BiocVersion")
```

:::

## So what packages can I use? 

Any package that has been released in the Bioconductor version you are using
(in this book version, this is `r packageVersion("BiocVersion")`).

The `BiocBaseUtils` package is available in Bioconductor since `3.16`, 
while the `BiocHail` package was only made available in `3.17`. 
`CuratedAtlasQueryR` has recently been accepted in `3.18` (current `devel`, on `r date()`).
Let's check this!

```{r}
packageVersion("BiocVersion")
BiocManager::available("BiocBaseUtils")
BiocManager::available("BiocHail")
BiocManager::available("CuratedAtlasQueryR")
```
